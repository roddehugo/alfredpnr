# Alfred PNR

As part of a development project at the [UFPE][ufpe], this application aims to publish a simple API which shamefully scrap Amadeus [CheckMyTrip](cmt) webservice.

## API description

The applicaiton expose the following routes:

1. /find/\<pnr\>/\<lastname\>

This routes accepts as parameters:

* the [PNR][pnr]: usually the 6-character code you received once your booking is completed
* the passenger lastname: obviously your lastname used for booking

## Code

The web part has been developped using [Flask][flask] microframework.
It uses the awesome [requests][requests] package for requesting Amadeus webservice.
Finaly, the scraping is orchestrated through the [lxml][lxml] package
